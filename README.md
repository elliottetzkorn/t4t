> :warning: **Local Development**: t4t does not yet support local development. I am taking steps towards making this work, but it might be a bit before I have a guide up for building the app locally. In the meantime though feel free to look through the code and suggest more surface-level changes.

# t4t

t4t is a focused social network for trans and gender-non-comforming people. It is beautiful, minimalist, text-based, and free. You can download it now, on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t4t-trans-community/id6474363537) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.t4t.app).

## Contact
Please keep conversation to the [Discussions](https://github.com/elliottetzkorn/t4t/discussions) tab. If you need specific help with the app, and do not have a Github account or do not wish to talk on here, feel free to use [email](mailto:support@t4t.social).

## Contributing

Before considering making a code contribution, I highly recommend following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=510QYduXBXc), which outlines building an app similar to t4t in terms of the essential stack: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/).

I would discourage you from creating pull requests for things which are not features or bugs already existing in the [Issues](https://github.com/elliottetzkorn/t4t/issues) tab. A good flow would be:
- Identify what you want to see changed in the app, and whether it is a feature or a bug
- If it requires conversation, try talking about it first in the [Discussions](https://github.com/elliottetzkorn/t4t/discussions) tab
- If you are fairly certain the problem is defined, check that it does not already exist in the [Issues](https://github.com/elliottetzkorn/t4t/issues) tab
- If the problem or feature is new, create an Issue, and then create a branch where you solve just that issue
- Open a pull requests against main from that branch and provide relevant information in the description, ideally including screenshots or video if the change affects the UI

## Support
The best way to support t4t is to become an active member of the app community by posting and chatting, or by spreading the word on your other social networks about how great this one is. 

If you want to help me out financially, become a Supporter in-app on the profile page! This is very much appreciated, and may one day come with perks!

## Colophon

t4t was neither developed nor designed in isolation. Here is a short list of its influences:

Waxwing, by [Michelle Lin](http://michellelin.co/), is the primary font. Originally it was intended (but never realized) for a botanical garden. It was inspired by a poem. Its creation was commissioned by..

..[Laurel Schwulst](https://laurelschwulst.com/). A presence in the spirit and feel of this project, and a nexus of people now close to me. Laurel asks interesting questions about computers, and the answers she has found through her work have inspired me. We share a love of perfume. We are roommates in New York City.

In the past I have gone on walks and hacked with [Peter Pelberg](https://pelberg.com/). Topics which came up between us included mindful interactions with applications, and the capturing of [drops of memory](https://pingpractice.org/). The imprint of time we shared exists in t4t.
